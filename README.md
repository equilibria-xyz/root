### Prerequisites

This repo works best with Node.js v16.x.x, this is preconfigured for users of [asdf](https://asdf-vm.com/).

Before running any command, make sure to install dependencies:

```sh
$ yarn
```

### Compile

Compile the smart contracts with Hardhat:

```sh
$ yarn compile
```

This also generates the Typechain types

### Test

Run the Mocha tests:

```sh
$ yarn test
```

To run tests against a Mainnet fork, set your `ALCHEMY_KEY` in `.env` and run

```sh
$ yarn test-integration
```

### Gas Report
To get a gas report based on unit test calls:

```sh
$ yarn gasReport
```

### Deploy contract to network (requires Mnemonic and infura API key)

```
npx hardhat run --network rinkeby ./scripts/deploy.ts
```

### Validate a contract with etherscan (requires API key)

```
npx hardhat verify --network <network> <DEPLOYED_CONTRACT_ADDRESS> "Constructor argument 1"
```
